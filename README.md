# Retail-and-Warehouse-Sales-Performance-Analysis
# Introduction

This project analyzes retail and warehouse sales performance to understand product movement, supplier contribution, and transfer behavior across warehouses. The analysis combines Python-based exploratory data analysis with an interactive Power BI dashboard to deliver actionable business insights.

# Objective

The objective of this analysis is to help business and operations stakeholders:

Monitor retail sales, warehouse sales, and transfer volumes

Identify top- and bottom-performing item types

Evaluate supplier contribution and dependency risks

Detect warehouses and suppliers with single transactions

Support inventory planning, supplier management, and sales optimization

# Description

The dataset includes transaction-level data related to:

Retail Sales

Retail Transfers

Warehouse Sales

Item Types

Suppliers



Data Preparation & Analysis

Python (EDA & Visualization):

Renamed columns for consistency and readability

Filled missing values to ensure data completeness

Created visualizations using:

Countplot for Top 5 Warehouses

Pie Chart for Top 5 Item Type distribution

Identified warehouses with single transfers

Categorical plots comparing:

Retail Transfers

Retail Sales

Warehouse Sales by Item Type

Power BI (Dashboarding):

Imported the processed dataset

Built KPI cards for:

Total Retail Sales

Total Retail Transfers

Total Warehouse Sales

Developed visuals for:

Top 3 Item Types

Bottom 3 Item Types

Top 5 Suppliers

Suppliers with single transactions

# Key Insights

Total Retail Sales: 208.19K

Total Retail Transfers: 197.82K

Total Warehouse Sales: 822.93K

Wine is the highest-performing item type, followed by Liquor and Beer

A significant number of suppliers have only a single transaction, indicating supplier dependency risks

Certain warehouses dominate transfers, while others show minimal activity

Bottom item types contribute very little to total volume, highlighting optimization opportunities
